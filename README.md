# Locale

Locale helps you discover and track the businesses in your neighborhood.

Set your home address and a radius, and Locale pulls in every business around you — restaurants, shops, services, and more — using OpenStreetMap data. From there, you can swipe through each business to mark it as visited or not visited, building a personal map of the places you know.

Use the dashboard to see your progress at a glance: how much of your neighborhood you've explored, broken down by category. The list view lets you filter and search through everything, and the map view shows your visits color-coded on a real map.

Locale is designed to be personal and local. All your data stays on your device — no accounts, no servers, no tracking. It's a simple tool for getting to know the area around you, one business at a time.
